<h1>Audio Visualizer</h1>

<p>This will be front-end heavy audio visualizer using Spotify's API. I still need to figure out what exactly I will need for this, but I will certainly be using React, Spotify's API, semantic UI, and possibly Web-Audio-API and other graphic rendering APIs.  I may switch from React to Vue if graphics become a heavy burden.</p>
